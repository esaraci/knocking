 \section{Final Notes}
 In conclusion, the aim of this work was to replicate what has been done in \cite{contiknocking} and \cite{contianalysis}; due to time and computational limitations I had to simplify my model, and luckily no loss of performance was encountered, allowing me to successfully reach the original results. Since the original papers might be a little outdated (the traffic data was captured in 2014), it might be interesting to perform the same kind of attack using current day's network traffic and evaluate if such issues still persist.
